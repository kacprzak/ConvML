  title = {Non-Linear Model for Dynamic Analysis of Conveyors},
  abstract = {This paper describes the dynamic analysis of a conveyor belt based
	on a finite element model. Each element in the
	
	model contains a mass, stiffness and damping component. In particular
	the stiffness element contains a non-linear
	
	characteristic to account for the stiffness behavior of the belt at
	low tensions. The dynamic model was produced
	
	from the static analysis of the conveyor which included an analytical
	drag model based on the work of Jonkers [4],
	
	Spaans [7], Wheeler [8] and SKF [2]. The analytical drag model has
	also been incorporated into the dynamic model
	
	to show the change in drag due to different tensions throughout the
	belt. The drag model described is based on the
	
	methods established in published papers. The result of this dynamic
	model is representation of the tensions in a
	
	conveyor belt. In particular it enables low tensions to be modeled
	accurately.},

  abstract = {Power consumption of long overland conveyors with a low slope component
	is examined in the paper. Rolling
	
	and position-dependent losses along a conveyor profile can significantly
	influence design of belting, take-up and
	
	drive requirements. Whilst the slope or gravitational component of
	belt tensions is definable, frictional
	
	components largely depend on an understanding of mechanical loss factors
	involved with the motion. Existing
	
	methods for quantifying belt tension of long low-lift conveyors are
	reviewed in the paper. Belt tension
	
	prediction methods such as DIN 22101 and CEMA are compared to alternative
	understandings of the rolling
	
	problem at the idler interface. Alternative predictive methods have
	been formulated to accommodate the effects
	
	of belt speed, sag, rubber properties and vertical loading at the
	idler contact zone. Application of the various
	
	predictive methods has been compared to results of selected site measurements
	to examine the loss factors and
	
	to fine tune models. Running losses affect the transient behaviour
	of conveyors during starting and stopping,
	
	particularly the selection of take-up position for practical dynamic
	control of belt tension},

  abstract = {Frictional and rolling losses along a running conveyor are discussed
	due to their important influence on wave
	
	propagation during starting and stopping. Hybrid friction models allow
	belt rubber losses and material flexing
	
	to be included in the initial tension calculations prior to any dynamic
	analysis. Once running tensions are
	
	defined, a numerical integration method using non-linear stiffness
	gradients is used to generate transient
	
	forces during starting and stopping. A modified Euler integration
	technique is used to simulate the entire
	
	starting and stopping cycle in less than 0.1 seconds. The procedure
	enables a faster scrutiny of unforeseen
	
	conveyor design issues such as low belt tension zones and high forces

	reduction in the ceramics industry avoiding product wear and fragmentation},
  booktitle = {BulkEurope 2010},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Belt conveyors have proven themselves for continuous conveying of
	bulk material for decades under technical and
	
	economic points of view. For long belt conveyors and large amounts
	of bulk material, steel cord conveyor belts represent
	
	the state of art. An increase of the applied material flow can only
	be obtained by the development of high tensile steel cord
	
	conveyor belts. Particularly high nominal strengths have been applied
	in the case of conveying systems which have to
	
	overcome considerable lifting heights and high bulk material flow
	rates. Conveyor belts are first spliced to form a
	
	continuous belt on the conveying system site. This is mainly due to
	the fact that both the winding diameters as well as the
	
	weight of the conveyor belts represent limits considering of transportation
	and handling. Conveyor belts therefore consist of
	
	a number of belt sections which are bonded through vulcanization,
	these sections rarely exceeding 400 m. Each conveyor
	
	belt has at least one and generally a number of splices. The splices
	represent weak parts in the conveyor belt. The strength
	
	of the splices is lower than the nominal strength of the belt. There
	are currently two competing development targets which
	
	can be identified in steel cord conveyor belt splicing: on the one
	hand the strength of the splice of the steel conveyor belts
	
	should be increased, while possibly accepting an increase of the installation
	costs. On the other hand, particularly in opencast

	economic points of view. For long belt conveyors and large amounts

	the state of art. An increase of the applied material flow can only
	be obtained by the development of high tensile steel cord
	
	conveyor belts. Particularly high nominal strengths have been applied
	in the case of conveying systems which have to
	
	overcome considerable lifting heights and high bulk material flow
	rates. Conveyor belts are first spliced to form a
	
	continuous belt on the conveying system site. This is mainly due to
	the fact that both the winding diameters as well as the
	
	weight of the conveyor belts represent limits considering of transportation
	and handling. Conveyor belts therefore consist of
	
	a number of belt sections which are bonded through vulcanization,
	these sections rarely exceeding 400 m. Each conveyor
	
	belt has at least one and generally a number of splices. The splices
	represent weak parts in the conveyor belt. The strength
	
	of the splices is lower than the nominal strength of the belt. There

	The heavier a conveyor belt is the more energy is needed to drive
	it. At the same strength,
	
	aramid fiber is 5 times lighter than steel and 3 times lighter than
	polyester. An aramid
	
	reinforced conveyor belt is much lighter than a steel belt so a reduction

	readily replace steel as
	
	belt reinforcement and references are available on long haul belts
	that are in successful
	
	operation since many years.
	
	Over half of a conveyor belt’s driving energy is lost in indentation
	rolling resistance of the
	
	belt. This is due to hysteresis when a rubber belt passes over its
	support rollers. Sulfron is a
	
	new Twaron-based rubber ingredient that lowers hysteresis. Data are

	δ (loss factor of energy in hysteresis) in several applications and
	a reduction in belt driving
	
	power of 15% is expected. First tests on belts are in progress.
	
	Thus due to its low weight, Twaron aramid as belt reinforcement reduces
	weight and hence
	
	the energy to drive the belt. Sulfron reduces hysteresis in belt rubbers
	and has the potential to
	
	reduce indentation rolling resistance considerably.},

	measure of the difference between the evolutions of the states of
	the system of particles as predicted in a

	Within the terminal, the coal is transported exclusively by 85 km

	penalties due to ship demurrage, stacker delays and tippler standing.
	Over the past two years, preventative belt maintenance has been given
	a high priority.
	
	
	The Applied Physics Group was commissioned to develop a high-speed

	belts on a monthly basis. The belts themselves are typically 2.2
	m wide, high-tension polyester cloth-based, and run at a speed of

	Although X-ray technology has been successfully employed for the online

	[1], both the high cost of such s-systems combined with safety issues
	due to the radiation hazard, discourages their use for permanent

	belts, typically every 6 months. Clearly, in this survey mode, corrective

	shorter than 6 months. Another alternative technique [2] that was
	developed some time ago measures the magnetic fringing fields that
	occur above breaks in previously magnetised cords. Initial implementations
	of this technology relied on a relatively few sensors and because
	these sensors were mostly coils, their output was proportional to
	the rate of change of the magnetic field. This signal, typically
	viewed on a chart recorder, was often difficult to interpret.

	considered as possible fuels have in excess of 60% dry basis moisture
	as mined. If this can be passively reduced during the mining and
	transportation of the material to the power station, then significant
	savings can be made in the quantity of fuel required at the station.
	With belt conveyor transport routes of up to 60 kilometres under
	consideration, opportunities exist for moisture loss to occur during
	the time the coal is on the conveyor.
	
	
	Two series of wind tunnel tests have been undertaken to identify the
	magnitude and rate of moisture loss by evaporation which can be expected
	from a conventional belt conveyor with sheetmetal covers. The tests
	concluded that for high moisture content coals, passive moisture
	loss from evaporation does occur and that, depending on atmospheric
	conditions, a reduction of between 3% and 5% can be expected over
	a conveyor route length of between 10 km and 50 km. The tests also
	gave indications of the optimum flight length to belt speed ratios
	before coal lump re-distribution should be undertaken on the conveyor
	to present fresh evaporation surfaces to the air stream. The effect
	of predominantly single size coal lump was assessed and it was shown
	that lump sizes of approximately 60 mm represented another optimal
	parameter for maximizing passive moisture loss. The effects of solar
	radiation on the sheetmetal covers has been reviewed and a method
	of exhausting saturated air from above the coal suggested.
	
	
	Full scale tests on very long belt conveyors handling material other
	than coal, the collection of air velocity profiles in the space between
	moving belt conveyors and their sheetmetal covers and a further series

	environment, conveyors as such, are not regarded as major sources
	of environmental pollution if properly operated and maintained. In
	fact, conveyors may make a positive contribution to the environment
	in that they can substitute motorised transport systems.
	
	
	The environment is increasingly receiving the attention of our global
	society and in some countries the penalties are extremely high. South
	Africa has joined this trend with the promulgation of a considerable
	number of Environmental Acts and Bills, most of which are going to
	have a direct impact on the responsibilities and liabilities of directors,
	other officials and employees as well as their employers.
	
	
	The Institute of Directors King Report on Corporate Governance released
	in November 1994 for the first time crystallised guidelines of so-called
	"best practice". The fact that some of these guidelines are being
	incorporated into legislation is a clear indication of the way in
	which things are moving. It is now a requirement to comply with Corporate
	Governance for a listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
	
	
	In my presentation I will attempt to bring the Environment, Corporate
	Governance, important legislation as well as the Constitution and
	conveyors under the spotlight and will highlight the main areas that
	will need attention.},

	surprised that two facets have received little attention. Firstly
	that today's conveyor designers are disadvantaged by having little
	or no physical contact with their creations. For one hundred years
	from the mid-nineteenth century designers and users were able to
	ride their conveyors and the majority did that. The belt speeds were
	rarely greater than 1,5m/s and the conveyors had relatively short
	centres. My own initiators insisted that I ride along the coalface
	to the pit bottom so that I could 'feel' belt stability plus the
	jiggling and jerks. The majority of other transport systems, like
	ships, planes and trains have retained their human bond, while Rocketry
	has actually introduced it. Perhaps this 'lack' has something to
	do with our industry's rather tardy development when compared with
	other modes. But, let me be absolutely clear, this in no way detracts
	from the achievements of those magnificent young men with their computer
	machines and the 3D imagery of transient forces. 
	
	
	Secondly, and my reason for this paper, is that we appear to have
	avoided the weakest link, certainly the one we confidently apply,
	but in truth the mechanics of which we still know so little.},

	from expansive damages caused by tramp iron. Equally, to protect
	the conveyors transporting the material from unwanted tramp iron
	damaging the belting and putting the conveyors out of action causing
	extensive and consequential damage to the receiving plant.
	
	To achieve these objects, the magnets need to be efficient, well designed,
	chosen for the correct application and installed correctly.
	
	If one of these above requirements is neglected the magnets will be
	of little value to the user.
	
	Magnetic separators have, during the years, the dubious distinction
	of being a necessary evil, something which has to be included in
	the layout of every new project.
	
	When confronted with the design of a conveyor system, the planner
	is aware that, somewhere, somehow, magnetic separators have to be
	included.
	
	The application is clear in his mind but there often seems to be some
	confusion where to install the magnetic separators. That is why it
	regularly happens that they are erected in placed most difficult
	to reach, to service, to check, for instance on top of big crushing
	or screening buildings, in transfer houses over huge surge bins,
	and similar places. That magnetic separators have a mass average
	of 15 tonnes seems irrelevant to the planner.
	
	The scope, design requirements and electric/magnetic requirements
	are often vague in Enquiry Documents being issued and objective performance
	guarantee rarely called for.
	
	It also happens that suppliers of magnetic separators are called in
	by estimators and told what budget has been allocated for magnets
	on a project. Usually the amount is too little.
	
	It is therefore not surprising to see so many magnets performing poorly
	on existing installations.
	
	It is wrong to conclude that this is a fact of life, that one has
	to live with it. It is false economy on the part of any user to choose
	incorrectly such magnetic separators.},

	Whilst mechanical engineers know at least the basics of electronic

	confused with hydrodynamic drives - hydraulic motors - which are

	no chance and electronic engineers even less than that. 
	
	
	The first exposure most engineers get to fluid couplings is when they

	of fluid couplings are rarely understood, so it is easy to see why
	one can think that electronics can perform the same function.

	and their electronic equivalent, the ramped voltage soft start and

	Brandspruit Colliery produces in average 8,7m tons of coal per annum
	with a peak of 9,1 million tons in 1997/1998. The coal is produced
	from 10 continuous miner sections over an area of approximately 2600-hectare
	underground.
	
	
	The total length of underground trunk conveyors at Brandspruit is
	approximately 3Okm, and that of the underground section conveyors
	approximately 28km. These conveyors transport the coal from the working
	face to a surface bunker.

	The principle of a mechanical frame transmitting a mass by means
	of a load cell to an electronic integrator is widely used in the
	weighing industry. The challenges in achieving accurate and reliable
	weighing on a conveyor belt are not in the design of the scale or
	the implementation of the scale on a conveyor system. They are in
	the application itself and the ability of the scale to maintain that
	"just installed" accuracy within the application. Over and above
	possible "integral failures" that can go undetected there are many
	"outside influences" that negatively affect the scales ability to
	weigh accurately and reliably. Conventional scales are unable to
	either detect, deal with or report all "integral failure" or "outside
	influence" when they negatively affect accuracy. Even if regular
	routine maintenance is done, and done properly, the scales "operational
	accuracy" cannot be guaranteed.
	
	The focus of this paper is on how improved technology has allowed
	improvements in design to overcome a major deficiency in the conventional
	conveyor belt scale. Before discussing the design improvements and

	weighing on conveyors and the many "invisible forces" making accurate

	and considering how best to tackle one of the most fundamental problems
	which face any plant operator responsible for bulk materials handling.
	
	
	
	We should not attempt to carry materials in sieves. Why? Because they
	leak. Yet in spite of that fact that materials handling plants leak
	just like sieves, we continue to use them because we don't have an
	alternative. A painful reminder of this fact is the lesson we learn
	daily that spillage, once on the floor, is difficult to pick up again.
	
	
	
	A useful exercise at the beginning of any analysis is an examination
	of what we don't know about a particular topic. What might we not
	know about spillage? For a start, we probably don't know how much
	it costs to make a mess in the first place. We probably don't know
	how much will it will cost to clean it up. We probably don't know
	how we will clean it up. Most important of all, however, we probably
	don't know what we could have done to prevent it happening in the
	first place. 
	
	
	What's the point of all this? Most materials handling plants are designed,
	installed and maintained without giving much attention to spillage
	prevention. Although my talk is entitled "Spillage Control", it might
	more accurately have been called "Spillage Prevention". 
	
	
	In the UK there have not been many new materials handling projects
	commenced recently but there are a great number of plants in operation.
	Whilst it is desirable to ensure that new plants don't spill, I'll
	leave that topic until later. The problems on existing plants pose
	the most extensive and difficult tasks to improve on spillage control/
	prevention.

  abstract = {This paper describes the design, construction, commissioning and related
	issues of the overland conveyor between Ripple Creek Mine and Orco
	plant at Redcliff in Zimbabwe operated by the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel
	Company, ZISCO. The detail describing the dynamic evaluation of this
	conveyor, does not form part of this paper. 
	
	The restructured ZISCO complex near KweKwe was commissioned at the
	start of 1997. This restructuring was necessitated by the depletion
	of the coarse iron ore supply from Buchwa mine, from where it is
	transported by rail to the steel plant. Additional supply of ore
	was available at Ripple Creek situated some 20 km south of the main
	plant and the use of a conventional trough conveyor as method of
	transporting the ore from Ripple Creek to Redcliff was found to be
	the most economical option. 
	
	The project was awarded to Bateman in 1992 against international competition
	and included the overland conveyor as well as the crushing and screening
	plant, materials handling and stockpile equipment at the head and
	tail of the conveyor. 
	
	
	The overland conveyor, when commissioned in January 1997 was the longest
	single flight, curved, steel cord conveyor in the world, having a
	total length of 15.6 km. Various factors, as described later in this
	paper, contributed to the extended period between contract award
	and final commissioning. The financial constraints alone postponed
	the effective start of the contract to 1994.},

	is mainly as a result of the belting itself. The belting is manufactured
	to comply with international standards in accordance with the type
	and strength class of the belt. As a result of these belts being
	different in type and construction, the Modulus of Elasticity will
	also vary. The Modulus of Elasticity determines the stretch of the
	belt and this is why the ramping technology needs to be considered
	in a serious light, as if the belt is accelerated too fast, then
	the energy imparted into the belt carcass will contract creating
	huge dynamic tension waves within the system.
	
	
	
	The modern conveyor is operating at considerably higher speeds and
	resultantly requires longer linear ramping profiles in order to prevent
	high-tension transients normally as a result of inappropriate ramping
	devices being selected.
	
	
	
	Belts generally used within the bulk materials handling industry are
	as follows:
	
	
	1. Steelcord Belting: Steel cord Belting is usually used in applications
	where high tensions are prevalent. These are generally found in long
	overland conveyors and incline conveyors. Steel cord belts are always
	vulcanised. The modulus of elasticity for Steel cord belting is high
	offering a belt with low stretch. The take up system therefore does
	not require a high take up response rate to accommodate the stretch
	induced by the drive.
	
	
	2. Ply or Fabric Belting: Usually used in plant conveyors. Ply belting
	can easily be joined by use of clip joints but can be vulcanised
	for permanent installations. Depending on the number of plies, this
	belting requires relatively large pulley diameters such that ply
	separation is minimised. Belt modulus is relatively low.
	
	
	3. Solid Woven Belting: It is current common practice to use PVC Solid
	Woven belting in underground fiery mining applications. Solid Woven
	belting can easily be joined by use of clip joints but can be finger
	spliced by using a hot vulcanising method. Solid woven belting is
	used with smaller pulley diameters than ply belting, but has a low
	modulus of elasticity and take up travel and resultant stretch is
	therefore high.},

	as amended, witnessed the introduction of one of the most significant
	pieces of legislation to the South African mining industry in its
	history.
	
	
	Management prerogative with regard to health and safety has effectively
	been negated through the principle of joint decision making as manifested
	in the provision for employee participation in such matters through
	health and safety representatives and health and safety committees
	at mines.
	
	
	At Rietspruit Mine, however, the contention of the people is that
	participation through representation is, at best, participation at
	arm length. It is believed that the spirit of the Act demands inclusively
	as much as it does representivity.
	
	
	Each person has the right to be included in decisions, which may affect
	his or her well-being. Providing forums for participation, therefore,
	is not good enough. Each Person should be empowered through development
	and training to ensure understanding of the issues at hand and the
	making available of such information as may be required to ensure
	effective participation in decision making.
	
	
	Morally the obligation is one of avoiding situations of mere employee
	attendance at participative forums where, more often than not, non
	participation is construed as silent consent to, or confirmation
	of, a decision, which may very well be ill-informed.
	
	
	Risk Assessment in terms of section 11 of the Act provides a most
	suitable means to give effect to the Rietspruit philosophy of participation
	whilst complying with the provisions and spirit of the legislation.
	
	
	This paper outlines the development of a risk management system at
	the mine and the implementation thereof, leading into a brief discussion
	on risk assessment as a subset of the process and touches on lessons
	learnt even during these early stages of the process of risk assessment.},

  abstract = {Fabric-reinforced conveyor belting is widely used for the transportation
	of various products (e.g. coal and ash in power stations). The ability
	to perform non-destructive condition monitoring of these belts would
	be beneficial to improve the reliability and availability of these
	belt transport systems.
	
	
	For numerous years, X-ray technology has been successfully employed
	for imaging defects in the cords of steel cord-reinforced belting
	but sufficient contrast was not achievable for fabric reinforced
	belting. The notion of imaging fabric belting using X-rays was previously
	thought not to be possible.
	
	
	In 2003, tests were conducted by the Applied Physics Group (APG) of
	the University of KwaZulu-Natal (Durban) to determine the feasibility
	of using Digital X-ray Imaging (DiXI) for
	
	
	condition monitoring of fabric-reinforced conveyor belting. The approach
	was to use low energy X-rays with sensitive, high-resolution digital
	X-ray cameras. APG evaluated various X-ray sources and cameras, and
	used readily available off-the-shelf technology. A laboratory rig
	containing belt samples attached to a rotating drum was used to simulate
	the linear motion of the conveyor belt.
	
	
	The investigation was successful, and was comprehensive enough to
	provide sufficient knowledge for the design, manufacture and implementation
	of a prototype system. Comprehensive tests conducted both in the
	laboratory and in on-site conditions have proven the suitability
	of DiXI to perform condition monitoring of conveyor belting. The
	internal structure of fabric-reinforced conveyor belting could be
	viewed with sufficient image contrast at belt speeds of up to 6 m/s.
	
	
	During 2004, Advanced Imaging Technologies (AIT) was contracted by
	Eskom Enterprises TSI to build a prototype X-ray system for scanning
	fabric-reinforced belting. Several surveys of belts were carried
	out by AIT using the DiXI system at two Eskom power stations. Some
	results from these surveys are presented here.},

	Prior to 1980 local conveyors were fitted with idlers manufactured
	to various American and European standards. Each idler manufacturer
	produced idlers with unique dimensions and roll fixing arrangements.
	In general the company who was responsible for the original equipment

	inventory costs and suffering from high obsolescence costs as critical
	dimensions changed with time.
	
	
	The need for a standard became obvious, and thus SABS 1313 was created

  abstract = {During transient operating conditions of belt conveyor systems complex
	vibrational phenomena occur under certain conditions in the upper
	and lower belts due to the continuous distribution of masses and
	elasticities. 
	
	
	Introductorily these phenomena are analyzed with regard to their generation,
	their main parameters and their effects on the complete belt conveyor
	system. 
	
	
	A brief presentation of a method explaining the transient operating
	conditions of belt conveyor systems by circulating elasto-mechanical
	travelling elastic waves (TEWs), and developed at the University
	of Hannover in the 70's, is given. 
	
	
	This is followed by an analysis concerning the influences of the main
	parameters on the magnitude of the TEWs and thus on the transient
	stresses of the belt and on the other components of the system in
	its non-steady operating conditions. 
	
	
	The analysis demonstrates that the rate of the drive units torque
	rise is a very important figure. 
	
	
	Basing especially on this parameter, recommendations for the optimization
	and calculation of the non-steady operating conditions of belt conveyors
	are given. 
	
	
	In consideration of the experience concerning the practical design
	of these conveyors with regard to their elasto-mechanical dynamic
	behavior, it is demonstrated that the complex finite element methods
	must not always be used for the calculation of the transient forces
	and velocities in the starting and stopping phases of belt conveyor
	systems. 
	
	
	This applies especially to those conveyors where the rate of the drive
	and brake unit's torque rise is higher than 5 up to 10 times the
	traveling time of the TEWs in the lower strand. 
	
	
	This is confirmed by the given presentation of experimental results
	concerning the dynamic behavior of a long-distance belt conveyor
	system.},

	Main parameters for an analysis of these operational phases are the
	corresponding accelerations and the total of peripheral forces of

	analyzed, and the product Cf, characterizing the frictional resistances
	to motion of belt conveyors, determines the acceleration behavior
	during starting and braking. Inclined conveyors are additionally
	characterized by the value of the quotient sin δ/(Cf) and in this

	downhill conveyors are considerably higher than in any comparable
	horizontal conveyor with the same power required and the same limitation
	of the driven or braked pulleys' peripheral forces in these transient

	A.C. drives for belt conveyor systems during their steady-state operation,
	in the first part of the contribution it is demonstrated that the
	more or less different utilization of the installed drive powers
	may occur with multiple arrangements of driving pulleys. As a consequence,
	under certain conditions this can lead to the overloading of some
	of the motors, while at the same time the rated power of other drives
	is not fully utilized. The main parameters and their fundamental
	relationships are introduced. The basis is given for calculating
	the load distribution in two-pulley arrangements, and thus for determining
	the utilization of the installed rated power of the drives. It is
	stated that even small differences of the effective pulley diameters
	exert a large influence on the load distribution. And, in addition,
	when selecting and designing conventional belt conveyor drives, attention
	has to be paid to the tolerances and the gradient of their torque-speed-characteristics
	as well as to the influence of the different types of conveyor belt.
	
	
	
	In addition to the load distribution, the problem of the thermal stress
	on conveyor belt drives during start-up is dealt with in detail.
	Especially with regard to the frequently used soft-start techniques
	to reduce belt stress, particularly for high-capacity overland belt
	conveyor systems with high belt speeds, the resulting thermal energy
	in conventional drives with non-frequency-controlled A-C. motors
	is of great significance in the design of motors or fluid couplings
	and starter resistors. In the last part of the contribution, relationships
	are introduced between the limitation of the drive forces during
	start-up and the resulting reduced start-up accelerators, as well
	as equations for calculating the amount of energy loss and the corresponding
	thermal stress due to the slip of the drive units during their start-up.
	In addition, information is given that permits an estimation of the

	Decline Conveyor Project. The engineering departments of the author's
	company and the Anglo American owned Kyuga Coal were responsible
	for the design.
	
	
	
	Kyuga Coal held a large investment in tunnelling and pre-existing
	trunk conveyor infrastructure in the Dartbrook Seam. Poor geological
	conditions led to underutilisation of the Dartbrook Seam, resulting
	in the possible shutdown of the operation.
	
	
	
	The Coal Seam above Dartbrook (Kyuga) and the coal seam above Kyuga
	(Piercefield) were the next prospects to be mined. Each of these
	would require, in normal procedural circumstances, considerable expense
	and time to drive and install a further set of trunk conveyor drive
	age & infrastructure prior to mining activities resuming for the
	Kyuga and then the Piercefield prospect.
	
	
	
	As with all new coal mine prospects, the capital infrastructure is
	weighed off against the return on investment and, methods were sought
	to reduce the capital investment for the Kyuga and Piercefield opportunities.
	The likelihood of successfully mining them would depend on reduction
	of capital & greatest utilization of existing infrastructure.
	
	
	
	Kyuga project management proposed a "Three-Seam Hump-Back Conveyor"
	(See Sketch # 1) which would carry the mined coal from the new Kyuga
	Seam up to the Piercefield Seam and then down to the Dartbrook Seam
	via a storage bunker. This proposal would enable the existing enormously
	valuable "Hunter Tunnel" drivage, conveyors & infrastructure to be
	used for the extraction of the entire Kyuga seam.
	
	
	
	The author's company proposed a conveyor system incorporating Variable
	Voltage Variable Frequency (VVVF) drive technology that would maximise
	the utilisation of the existing infrastructure. The features of the
	system allowed for, following mining the Kyuga seam, the shortening
	of the "Hump Back" conveyor from tail end towards delivery point
	thus positioning a new "Load" point in the Piercefield seam further
	above the Kyuga seam such that the same conveyor and existing infrastructure
	& drivage could be utilized along with the Dartbrook Hunter Tunnel
	infrastructure.},

	calculation methods of its resistance to motion. Such methods have
	been developed upon the theoretical analysis of physical phenomena
	that occur in the running belt conveyor. Such analysis is based on
	the detailed investigations of the movement of a belt supported by
	idlers, followed by appropriate laboratory tests and in-situ measurements.
	The approach allows to identify the impact of all important parameters
	(like mechanical properties of a belt and transported bulk solid
	material) on the resistance to motion with the use of physical equations
	of loads, tensions, displacements and deformations rather than dimensionless,
	controlled by empirical constants, equations that were typical in
	earlier, simplified calculation methods. As a result, the theoretically
	proven and verified by test calculation methods of belt conveyor
	resistance to motion are capable to deal with any designed belt conveyor
	installation. Though conveyors usually consist of standard elements
	each new installation is unique and requires multivariate calculations
	of all considered, optional solutions to get the best one. This is
	the only approach that ensures the proper design of a conveyor since
	the entry phase of the project. In the Institute of Mining Engineering
	of the Wroclaw University of Technology the investigations in the
	field of belt conveyors and belts have been carried out for many
	years [1, 2]. The original method of calculation of belt conveyor
	main resistance to motion has been developed on the basis of theoretical
	analysis of the energy dissipation processes in a conveyor belt and
	in the material load stream, as well as the analysis of the interaction
	between the belt and idlers. Based on the obtained algorithm, an
	"in-house" computer program has been written used both for consultancy
	purposes at the University and for operational use by several Polish
	open cast lignite mines and belt conveyor equipment suppliers [3].
	Among others tasks the program has been employed for calculating
	the innovative projects like the first in Poland pipe-belt conveyor,
	the curvilinear conveyor in the lignite pit "Turow", boosted conveyors
	with additional belt drive and an all-new modular belt conveyor with
	several compact drive units distributed along the bottom belt and

  abstract = {From transportation of bulk materials in underground and open-cut
	mines to applications in power stations and processing plants to
	name but a few, belt conveyors are widely used as an economical continuous
	conveying method. Most of these industries rely strongly on conveyor
	transfers to divert material from one conveyor to another at some
	point in their system. The unfortunate reality is that some companies
	will be driven by cost minimisation for the short-term rather than
	planning for the long-term. This will result in bad decisions being
	made and the incorrect conveyor transfer being installed with flow-on
	effects such as downtime for modifications or even replacement.
	
	
	
	There are many facets to the design of a successful transfer chute
	including minimising product impact, degradation, chute wear, noise,
	dust and spillage while maximising the material velocity to allow
	the product to leave the chute at or near the speed of the receiving
	conveyor. Fully understanding the behaviour of a material is paramount
	to designing a successful transfer chute. Accurately determining
	the material discharge and trajectory from the head pulley is the
	first step in this design process.
	
	
	
	This paper will focus on the determination of the material trajectory
	as it leaves the belt conveyor head pulley. This process will also
	determine the point at which the material leaves the belt, referred
	to as the discharge angle. There are numerous methods available in
	the literature focusing on the modelling of material discharge and
	trajectory, including C.E.M.A. [1,2,3,4,5], M.H.E.A. [6, 7], Booth
	[8], Golka [9,10], Korzen [11], Goodyear [12] and Dunlop [13]. These
	methods have been evaluated for both horizontal and inclined belts
	for a range of belt speeds and pulley diameters to evaluate both
	low and high-speed conditions. The results of these evaluations have
	been compared to allow comment on their ease of use, completeness

	polyester materials for the tension member in the belting to increase
	the strength yet retain the degree of flexibility necessary for troughed
	conveyor belts. However, with the need for longer conveying distances
	and higher capacities, these materials were incapable of performing
	their required function due to both the excessive rigidity of the
	belting, caused by multi-strand thickness, and excessive elasticity
	of the resultant system.
	
	
	Subsequently, higher powered conveyors utilised steel cord belting
	where the steel cords dramatically increased the tension characteristics
	of the belting whilst retaining belting flexibility. The successful
	introduction and use of such conveyors in British coal mines is well
	documented. In recent years however, belting manufacturers have been
	encouraged to develop solid woven fabric core belting beyond the
	proven Type 15 belting, i.e. 15000 lbf/in width, in order to eliminate
	the problems of susceptibility of steel cord belting to damage and
	hence corrosion of the steel cords. However, a successful design
	of fabric belting would have to compete with steel cord belting in
	terms of minimising stretch such that loop take-up lengths on long
	conveyors are minimised, and hence minimise the cost of expensive
	enlarged roadway cross sections.

	calculations required to determine specific power loss components.
	Other papers have presented field measurements and case studies [5,
	6, 7].
	
	The focus on belt conveyor power consumption is no doubt due to the
	fact that this single value dictates a significant portion of the
	conveyor design. Pulley design forces, belt ratings, structural loads,
	and major equipment selection are but a few items based on this value.
	Furthermore, without accurate steady state power estimates, the dynamic
	behaviour of the system and governing control logic can not be determined.
	
	By investigating and thoroughly understanding each of the major power
	loss components, the engineer can design safer, more reliable, and
	more economical conveyor systems. The boundaries of overland conveyor
	design have not even begun to slow down over the past three decades.
	The use of new and advanced conveyor technologies continues to push
	the limits of what was once considered either too risky, or to costly.
	
	The intention of this paper is to discuss the components that constitute
	the belt conveyor power requirements, and also to show how these
	components are typically calculated. Many of the basic principles
	have been known for decades. However, with current computing power,

	When possible the equations will be compared with experimental measurements.

	This equipment is often not taken seriously enough through ignorance
	and in many cases simply poor engineering, selection of equipment
	and application. Magnets and metal detectors are an inseparable part
	of mining and a very wide range of industrial processes. The paper
	deals with the various types of equipment in broad terms, the application
	of same and the selection in a general sense for various industries.
	
	
	
	The principle of separation of unwanted tramp metal from various products
	is quite simple. We try to find the best way to maximise the possibility
	of a magnet removing metal from streams of many varied materials
	which can be in the form of large lumps, fine products, wet products,
	sticky products and so on. 
	
	
	The paper is intended as a general guide to a better understanding
	of the operation and application of magnets and metal detectors and
	a common sense approach to the correct selection of these items.},

  abstract = {Belt conveyors have proven themselves excellently for the transport
	of mineral raw materials and earth. Today, they are in most cases
	the most cost-effective solution for handling bulk material mass
	flows over short and medium conveying tracks. Despite the already
	advantageous costs for belt conveyor operation, there is a desire
	to reduce these costs even further. Literature source [1] states
	that, in order to balance the filling level, the belt speed should
	be controlled in accordance with the load. As a result, energy consumption
	should decrease. Publications [2, 3] give the impression that a reduction
	of the energy consumption by up to 30% is possible, if, by controlling
	the conveying speed with the nominal volume flow as a leading quantity,
	i. a. a filling level of q> = 1 (= 100%), the belt conveyor can also
	be operated if the volume flow is subject to fluctuations. In this
	context, literary sources [2, 3] mention distances between axes of
	more than 1400 m. In its summary, literature source [4J also suggests
	that more economical operation is achieved, if variable-speed drives
	are used for belt conveyors. In literature source [2, 3], DIN 22
	101 [5] (draft) is used as a basis for these statements. Publications
	[1, 4] do not name sources for these statements.
	
	
	
	Against this background, I have been asked by Voith Turbo, Crailsheim,
	Germany, to provide an expert's opinion whether - universally applicable
	- the energy consumption of belt conveyors is reduced and hence allows
	more economical operation, if the filling level Φ of the belt trough
	is utilized with Φ = 1.},

	depending on the conveyor design engineer. Anything from basic on/off
	control over multi-level braking to proportional control has been
	tried in the past and proportional control is widely used on belt
	conveyors today. This paper describes the development of intelligent
	hydraulic brake control and some of the well-documented intelligent
	brake control systems used on belt conveyors over the last 4-5 years.
	
	
	
	In the mid 1990's brake manufacturers started to use proportional
	brake control - or a combination of proportional and digital control
	- for belt conveyors. The first microprocessor based brake control
	from Svendborg Brakes was introduced 1998 - the Soft Braking Option
	and it formed the basis of the current programmable Soft Braking
	Option with Pulse Width Modulation, an intelligent brake controller
	with a user-friendly interface and some programmable features.
	
	
	
	The first Soft Braking Option product was primarily designed for the
	Wind Turbine industry with the purpose of controlling normal stops
	and emergency stops. The results of the first attempts to control
	a deceleration - and adjust parameters on site - were not promising.
	
	
	
	The need for more adjustable parameters in the regulation process
	determines the specification of the brake control systems. The next
	step from the Soft Braking Option is to use a complete PLC to control
	the brake unit(s) - this has been successfully done several times
	with good results.

  abstract = {Since the foundation of BERNHARD BEUMER MASCHINENFABRIK in 1935 the
	belt conveying technology has been forming an essential part of the
	company's scope of supply. 
	
	
	The basis for the initial activities in the field of belt conveying
	technology was a patent for the sealing of the idler bearing. 
	
	
	Afterwards the manufacturing program had been extended consequently
	according to the customers' requests. 
	
	
	Today the range of products includes the fields of conveying, loading,
	palletizing, packaging and distributing systems. 
	
	
	The main market for the "conveying technology" was and still is the
	cement and building material industry. 
	
	
	In the Sixties BEUMER made the basic work in the field of troughed
	belt conveyors with horizontal curves. The theoretical considerations
	and calculations found their practical realization in the establishment
	of the first curved belt system for Holderbank in Switzerland, which
	was put into service in 1970 as transport connection to the cement
	factory Wildegg. 
	
	
	The customer's requests regarding conveying technology lead to studies
	of new system and transport conceptions with alternative designs.
	The demand for more narrow curve radii, larger inclination angles
	and a higher total economy of the conveying systems were essential
	project parameters. 
	
	
	Based on the individual parameters new curved belt conveyor systems
	were realized by application of the belt sack conveyor, the tube
	belt conveyor and the troughed belt conveyor. These three conveying
	systems can be characterized and differentiated by the distinctive
	features as conveying method (open/closed), minimal curve radius,
	maximum volume flow rate, design of the conveying belt and the type
	of belt control. 
	
	
	Hereinafter examples of realized systems, which have been put into
	service recently, will illustrate the practical use of curved belt
	conveyor systems.},

  abstract = {Up until a few years ago , when conveyors in South Africa were rather
	small compared with their counterpart in other countries overseas,
	the need for engineered systems was limited.
	
	
	With the advent of the oil crisis this situation changed over night
	for two reasons , i.e. diesel fuel vehicles became almost too expensive
	to use and secondly the demand for coal as a fuel became increasingly
	important. In order to mine the coal economically , it became necessary
	to increase the tonnage mined , as well as to improve the method
	of transporting the coal that was mined.
	
	
	The obvious answer to the problem was to use conveyor belts in conjunction
	with unit trains and sophisticated loading and unloading stations.
	
	
	Coal mining was not the only type of mine effected by the rise in
	cost of oil based fuels , but also the base minerals , such as iron
	are , copper and uranium.
	
	
	It was the base mineral mines , which at the time of the oil crisis
	, that were using the open cast method with electro haulpacks for
	transporting the ore and overburden more so than the Collieries.
	
	
	Unfortunately or fortunately for South Africa , the change from small
	or medium size conveyors to large installations happened virtually
	overnight and the technology to undergo the change was not readily
	available , hence people in the conveyor field used their limited
	existing knowledge to try and make the larger and more sophisticated
	conveyors.
	
	
	This knowledge was however insufficient and hence resulted in many
	failures. The most noticeable failures being that of terminal Pulleys
	and belting. The idler manufacturers seemed however , to have escaped
	the lime light , either because they were more prepared for the change
	and sufficient technology was available from their overseas parent
	company , or the time and the cost to replace idlers was not sufficient
	to warrant an investigation.
	
	
	With the terminal Pulleys , a different situation arose. Just about
	every mining house and other conveyor orientated companies saw the
	need to improve the standard and the design of Pulleys. However ,
	unlike Germany and other countries , each individual concern tried
	to develop standard and design on their own , without consulting
	each other.
	
	
	The end result of these standards can only be classed as disastrous
	and unnecessary waste of money and time , as none of the standards
	are competable with each other , except for one thing , and that
	is the rigidity of the expected standard of workmanship and the amount
	of paper required to prove the soundness of the equipment.
	
	
	By the amount of paper required, I mean, this so called quality assurance
	procedures , whereby it has now become necessary to prove that even
	the smallest Pulley, which is just an oversize idler , passes full
	pressure vessel tests.
	
	
	It is not that I am opposed to quality assurance , but just that I
	feel that the relationship between quality control and purpose of
	use should be equated so as to build a unit fit for service at the
	right price.
	
	
	This bring me to the definition of an engineer , which goes as follows:-
	" An Engineer is someone who can build for a penny, what any old
	fool can build for a pound ".
	
	
	When our company went into the manufacture and design of Pulleys like
	everyone else, we went our own way to establish a standard , but
	with a difference. We first tried to find out how people overseas
	were tackling the problem. During the course of this investigation
	we found out that Germany , Australia and some parts of the United
	States had all had their problems when they changed over from small
	to big conveyor belts. Germany in particular , where most of the
	large material handling plants are designed seemed to have spent
	many years in developing their technology in conveying with the emphasis
	on conveyor Pulleys. At Hannover University two doctorates were awarded
	for research and development in conveyor Pulleys.
	
	
	By dealing with the right people , we were able to get hold of copies
	of both these doctorates , as well as many other papers written about
	conveyor Pulleys. By tabulating this information , we arrived at
	the bases of our design.},

	dynamics of conveyor belts on the design of a conveyor system started
	halfway the 1950's. It was however not until halfway the 1980's that
	the first useful design tool became available. In the early days
	of using dynamics of belt conveyor systems the attention was focused
	on an analysis of both the starts and the stops of long overland,
	high tonnage/lift/speed conveyors. With the significant improvement
	of drive technology over the last twenty years however, it is now
	possible to start and (operationally) stop a belt conveyor in a very

	the application of belt conveyor dynamics is not any longer required
	provided that sufficiently long starting and stopping times are used.
	The attention therefore shifted to the analysis of emergency stops
	and the determination of 'what if' scenarios. It is an illusion to

	on dynamic conditions, tension waves, belt resonance etc. Delegates
	then go back, file their papers and promise themselves that some
	day, when they have an application, they will dig them up again.
	
	
	
	If we look at the enquiries issued, and the technical quality of some
	tenders offered, it is clear that there is a great need in our industry
	to address design issues at a more basic level. 
	
	
	Buyers often do not realise the implications of their specified requirements,
	and contractors and suppliers have done very little to work together
	to produce design guidelines and national standards. 
	
	
	Due to the lack of clear specifications and available standards, for
	a simple conveyor system, there are invariably as many alternatives
	offered for belt -tensions, drives etc. as there are tenderers. 
	
	
	Gearbox suppliers, for instance, are often required to prepare 10
	different quotations for 10 different tenderers, sometimes, even
	with two or three alternatives for each tenderer. often, each of
	these quotations have to be accompanied by completed technical schedules,
	often in excessive detail and outline drawings. 
	
	
	The industry, with both human and financial resources already very
	thinly spread, cannot afford this situation, and neither can the
	buyers and end users afford the risk of incomparable tenders and
	over or under designed plants. 
	
	
	The aim of this paper is therefore to illustrate the influence of
	various and conflicting basic design criteria and specifications,
	and to indicate the Cost and technical quality effects, with specific
	reference to belt conveyors. At the same time the paper stresses
	the importance of clearly defined and well researched criteria and
	specifications to ensure that all parties involved i.e. client, designer
	and supplier, are using the same basis and have the same understanding
	of what is required and what should finally be provided. 
	
	
	To reach this objective, it is proposed that a body such as the Institute
	of Mechanical or Materials Handling Engineers, or the Conveyor Manufacturers
	Association, or any other new body, is used to co-ordinate all different
	aspects and attempts to produce acceptable standards.},

	is geometrically complex which lends itself well to CAD methods.
	Solids based modeling systems can deal with complex geometry and

	Coupled to the accurate prediction of reclaim capacity is the stress
	distribution within a stockpile. There have been several papers published
	in recent years predicting a pressure dip at the center of a conical
	stockpile resulting in what has been termed the 'M' distribution.

	One of the more noticeable areas of conflict or should we say terminology
	is that of the surcharge angle as specified in DIN and that specified
	in ISO, CEMA etc., were the angle value is calculated differently
	and therefore volumetric capacities for the same angle are some 50%
	in variance.
	
	
	There are a number of areas such as this where DIN, ISO, CEMA approach

	There are also areas where standards are not readily available or

	This paper looks at 2 main aspects where the latter is the case and
	attempts to highlight the problem areas. These areas being that of
	idlers and their supporting structures.
	
	
	For years consumers have been plagued by premature idler roll failures
	and installations in which the belts refuse to train. They have lived
	with seal failure, bearing failure and roll failure.
	
	
	The industry has attempted to correct the situation by specifying
	the L10 life of the idler roll bearings, specifying the bearings
	themselves, specifying the maximum allowable deflection in the shaft.
	They have specified shaft tolerances, end float, the run out on the
	roll diameter, yet failures still persist.

	a conveyor belt. This is mainly due to the following factors: 
	
	
	- the splice forms a discontinuity in the tension-transmitting members
	of a belt 
	
	- forces are no longer transmitted by steel cords only but also surrounding
	rubber 
	
	- the distribution of forces within a splice is no longer uniform.
	
	
	
	Safety factors commonly applied during belt selection attempt to prevent
	a possible loss of splice strength during service. In principle the
	life of a splice should be as long as the parent belt but this is
	very often not achieved for the following reasons: 
	
	
	(a) the abovementioned safety factors take operational conditions
	into account rather than mechanics of the splice. 
	
	(b) the site execution of splices is heavily dependant on quality
	of workmanship (both in general and detail). 
	
	
	Over the years, overseas research centers have been involved in projects
	which aimed at better understanding of splice behaviour, possible
	mathematical modeling and the improvement of the long term strength
	of the splice.

	By doing so conveyor behavior becomes predictable to the point that
	lower safety factors can be applied. 
	
	
	Due to various constraints smaller installations do not utilise such
	techniques and more often than not torque control during start-up
	is very basic at most. 
	
	
	One of the more popular devices used on the South African market is
	fluid coupling of consent filling type. 
	
	
	That long standing popularity has been recognised by the leading suppliers
	and significant effort has been made to improve operating characteristics
	of those couplings allowing their application to be used in longer
	and more powerful conveyors. 
	
	
	It is unfortunate that in some instances start-up performance is unsatisfactory
	and one of the remedies offered is replacement of the simpler torque
	controlling device (in this case fluid couplings of constant fill)
	with more complex and more expensive system. 
	
	
	Another fact is that bad start-up performance is compounded by inherent
	faults of the design, the question then can be asked if an installation
	using fluid couplings of constant fill type can have its start-up
	performance improved without going into full re-design of the conveyor
	or replacement of major components?

  abstract = {A stoppage in the conveyor transport system means no production in
	most mining applications. Whether the stoppage is due to a minor
	problem or a major problem, the effect is the same.
	
	In the coal industry with conveyors carrying between 1,000 and 3,500
	tonnes per hour, losses of revenue between $600 and $1,800 Australian
	dollars per minute can be expected while a conveyor is not operating.
	
	This paper looks at the failure modes in conveyor systems that can
	lead to lost production. It investigates how various types of electronic
	monitoring are quickly identifying problems and even predicting problems
	before they occur. It looks at how a monitoring system should be
	integrated into the over-all maintenance plan of the mine and how
	best to allow management to view this information.
	
	The paper provides examples of current systems in use throughout Australia
	and the equipment and techniques employed to provide the monitoring.
	Personnel training requirements are covered. The practical experience
	of Engineers involved in this area, provide the "do's and don'ts"
	of conveyor monitoring.
	
	Finally methods for determining the success of a monitoring system
	are discussed and some more unusual side benefits that Management
	and Engineers have found, may provoke your imagination.},

	that are often overlooked by conveyor designers and which could lead
	to operational problems that last the life of the conveyor. The application
	of belt cleaner types, the material of construction, the cleaning
	action and their compatibility with given conditions will be discussed,
	from the point of view of a conveyor designer in the South African
	mining industry. Belt cleaners have applications for materials that
	range from run of mine ore down to microscopic tailings, through
	the spectrum of hard rock, shale, coal and clay.
	
	
	Much has been said and written over the years regarding the cleanliness,
	or otherwise of conveyor systems. Since the concept of a belt conveyor
	for handling bulk materials was introduced, the problem of spillage
	and carry-back has been one which has vexed both conveyor designers
	and especially operators. The need for a universal, inexpensive,
	effective and efficient belt cleaner has led to the design of a plethora
	of cleaners, of varying degrees of success. The lives of the cleaners
	were not always of any significant duration. The result is that there
	are many salvage yards, on mines, plants and factories, that have
	served as the final resting place for these devices.
	
	
	In many cases, the user's approach to belt cleaning is purely commercially
	driven, short sighted and based entirely on economic considerations.
	This implies that the selection of a particular type of cleaner is
	often based on the lowest cost, rather than the suitability or efficiency
	of the cleaner system. Belt cleaners, of the human type, are a treatment
	of the symptoms, rather than the illness. If we have to employ unskilled
	labour to lash the spillage back onto the system, then the original
	system must be seen as partly deficient and in need of attention.
	Manual belt cleaning must be intermittent and often the response
	to a cleaning problem occurs only after the damage has been done.
	Hence the need for mechanical, automatic and continuous belt cleaning
	and dribble handling.},

	Two standards that contain recommendations on the thickness of conveyor

	are: 
	
	
	The American RMA-Handbook 
	
	The German Standard DIN 22 101 
	
	
	Grades for the quality of cover rubber were established when natural
	rubber was the only rubber material available. When synthetic rubber
	came along the old grades had to be reconsidered. In the USA all
	grading based on physical figures was dropped. In Europe and other
	countries an abrasion test was introduced to improve the chances
	of predicting the behaviour under service conditions. 
	
	
	Figures for 3 grades from 4 national standards and from the International
	Standard are compared. 
	
	
	In the light of experience gained in the field it must be recognised,
	that these grades excluded compounds which had proved better for
	certain conditions. Research on abrasion testing methods confirmed
	that the established abrasion test provides results which are not
	consistent with the results from other tests. The new test methods
	are described. 
	
	
	The latest revision of German Standard DIN 22131 warns against taking
	for granted a reliable connection between cover grades and service
	life. 
	
	
	Up to now, tensile strength and elongation at break are the only properties
	used to judge the resistance of a rubber compound to cut and gouge
	stresses. During a research project a test bench for continuous testing
	of cut and gouge stresses was developed. The force to create cuts
	and gouges was measured. The test bench is described. No correlation
	was found between this force and the figures for tensile strength
	or tear strength. But the results obtained so far are derived from
	too small a number of tests for us to be able to draw final conclusion.
	So in this area, the research needs to go on.},

	capital expenditure. 
	
	•The preservation of belt life is a key factor in reducing maintenance
	costs.

  abstract = {Very often, materials handling systems serving mines have been designed
	and commissioned with due regard for the metallurgical and process
	requirements, but with little or no regard for the conveying systems,
	sometimes with disastrous effect.
	
	
	For example, it is common to primary crush are and waste in the pit
	to a "conveyable size" based on the belt width required, and to have
	all subsequent crushing done in the plant. The overburden waste will
	never be crushed again and as a result there is considerable conveying
	of large rocks, which have only been subjected to primary crushing.
	
	
	This paper covers the decisions that the process engineer together
	with the materials handling engineer must make, which greatly affect
	the good design of the downstream conveying systems.
	
	
	The following aspects are discussed in this regard:
	
	Material types vs. crusher product
	
	
	Lump impact energy and its disastrous effects on conveyors The handling
	of dense ores

  abstract = {Seeing an extensive demand for raw materials in China, India and to
	a lesser extent in Europe prompts an ever-increasing need to transport
	high volumes of base metals, coal and similar commodities. Servicing
	the growing demands for bulk transportation of such materials to
	fuel this exploding global infrastructure expansion, the development
	of belt conveyor systems has seen an unprecedented increase in popularity.
	Simply increasing size, speed and related capacity is today totally
	unacceptable because in an environmentally sensitive world, issues
	such as dust generating, spillage and the associated pollution is
	permanently under the scrutiny of the developers and operators alike.
	Today we see Ports clogged with bulk vessels waiting to load their
	cargo and there is not a single port considering, preparing or developing
	its facilities to meet this growing worldwide demand.
	
	To this end, we, as designers have a duty to make the systems we develop
	stand up to the rigours of providing truly well designed equipment
	which offer high availability, coupled to the associated ease of
	maintenance in a breakdown situation. To be able to guarantee quick
	and simple start up, to rapidly identify failures and to predict
	the possible future failure before they occur. This has been identified
	as introducing intelligence into the equipment we provide.
	
	Over the years, we have seen the introduction of many "innovative"
	solutions to materials handling problems; the "Pipe Conveyor" to
	eliminate transfer points and reduce blow off dust emissions. The
	"Triangular Gantry" and "Maintenance Trolley" to allow cost effective
	elevation of conveyors away from the problems of Port sterilization
	and quick access to the maintenance area. Presently we are developing
	idlers with temperature sensors, which will warn of pending failure,
	and coupling this to the Maintenance Trolley we will be able to send
	the trolley to automatically monitor and replace damaged idlers.
	
	These new innovations are helping with the required improvements in
	system availability but we are still to fully address the biggest
	cause of damage, wear and serviceability, this being referred to
	as the transfer point.
	
	The normal requirement at a typical Port can be the transportation
	of 2,000 to 15,000 tons of ore per hour, transport as much as 30
	different products through the same system of conveyor belts and
	transfer points. These products can vary from pellets, to fine high
	moisture ores, to dusty powders. Consideration must also given to
	conveying high impact materials which are not very forgiving to poor
	chute design making prediction of flow paths of immense importance.
	
	This paper sets out to show the processes being applied to the development
	of transfer points at three of South Africa's export terminals namely
	Saldanha Bay, Port Elizabeth and Richards Bay Dry Bulk Terminal.
	
	To highlight the work being undertaken, this paper concentrates on
	the following aspects of chute development:
	
	The effect of flexibility on the availability of associated equipment
	
	Transfer point complication
	
	Computer modelling of material flow . Wear protection
	
	Dust emission
	
	Maintenance and finally
	
	Condition Monitoring
	
	This focus is an ongoing development of what has been termed "Condition
	Monitoring" normally associated with belting, pulleys, idlers and
	drive components.
	
	However this need to effectively transfer different materials on the
	same conveying system results in the need for the establishment of
	a totally defined procedure to operate and maintain the transfer
	points, including simple methods of defining liner wear and undertaking
	inspections resulting in the achievement of predictive scheduled
	maintenance.},

  abstract = {Based on years of global experience the authors describe the thought
	process or procedure that is typically followed in an attempt to
	correct bulk solids flow problems in production and process equipment.,
	Most of the time, solutions are temporary without a regard or full
	understanding of the problem and the associated economic impact to
	the overall operation of the facility. When a temporary solution
	does not perform adequately another one is usually tried. Some of
	these short term attempts will be as simple as a sledgehammer while
	others will be more elaborate. 
	
	
	To properly understand a bulk solids flow problem and how to correct
	it, the bulk solid's flow properties should be analysed. With this
	information, and engineer can determine whether the equipment is
	properly designed and whether a flow promotion aid will correct the
	problem. Sometimes it will be a combination of approaches. It is
	recognised that most cohesive bulk solids should be handled in hoppers
	that are designed for mass flow. This type of pattern is reliable
	and predictable. 
	
	
	In addition to a properly sized outlet, the design of a mass flow
	bin must consider the hopper wall angles, wall material and its surface
	finish and the average and worst case condition of the solid's flow
	properties. The hopper walls must be steep and have a low enough
	friction for material to flow along them. 
	
	
	In many cases, the design of the bin is proper but the wall material
	may not have a low enough friction. Then a retrofit with a low friction
	liner becomes very practical. The choice of a qualified installation
	contractor is very important. The contractor should be able to perform
	his work in a variety of adverse conditions with knowledge of bulk
	solids handling problems. 
	
	
	The SYSTEMTIVAR solutions approach to flow problems is designed to
	tackle a project from problem identification to a turnkey installed
	solution. After determining that a low friction liner is a solution,
	a study begins on the installation site to fully understand what
	will be required to complete the project. The engineers at the job
	site as well as the installation contractor will agree on the procedures
	to be followed during the installation. Poly Hi Solidur will complete
	all of the engineering and design that is required for completion
	of the project to insure that proper effectiveness of the liner can
	be achieved. Once all parties are in agreement as to what will be
	done, the preparation begins.},

	all variations and interdependencies between sub-systems. It guides
	management in deciding on the goal of the business, identifying the
	constraints that prohibit us from better performance, and lead management

  abstract = {For the purpose of this paper on High Speed Conveyor Idlers we will
	be taking results obtained from actual on-site tests and tests carried
	out at Research Laboratories. In addition to these, a number of vibration
	test results from our in-house test bed will be considered. From
	on-site experience and the conclusions obtained from the above tests,
	the final minimum requirements for High Speed Idlers have been ascertained.
	
	
	
	During the development of SABS 1313, conveyor systems were running
	at less than 4 m/s (787,2 ft/min) and the set-down limits and tolerances
	were in keeping with this requirement. 
	
	
	With the ever-increasing demand for higher capacity conveyors, it
	has become necessary for the conveyor industry to increase belt widths
	and belt speeds to a point where 6 m/sec (1181,4 ft/min) is becoming
	common practice. 
	
	
	These increased speeds and belt widths have introduced a number of
	problems, which had not been encountered on the lower capacity conveyors.
	
	
	
	This has forced the conveyor idler manufacturer to take a more scientific
	approach to the selection, design and manufacture of both the rolls
	and bases in order to meet the requirements of users and still produce
	an idler at a realistic price.},

  abstract = {Mining and mineral processing industries throughout the world rely
	on the efficient transportation of bulk solid. Belt conveyors have
	been used for the transportation of bulk solid over relatively short
	distances for many years, but with significant developments in analytical
	procedures to describe the dynamic properties of belt conveying systems,
	the utilisation of belt conveyors for long distance overiand transportation
	is becoming more economically viable. Belt conveyor installations
	are becoming progressively longer and belt speeds significantly faster,
	and as these trends continue it becomes increasingly important that
	the motion resistances associated with the operation of belt conveyors
	be minimised for optimum performance and efficiency. In the energy
	conscious worid in which we live, no longer is it acceptable for
	a belt conveyor to simply transport bulk solid from one point to
	another, the operation must be economically viable, environmentally
	friendly and energy efficient.
	
	
	The energy consumed in raising bulk solid from one level to another
	is typically a parameter that cannot be easily changed, and is usually
	determined by plant constraints or the terrain over which the conveyor
	is travelling. As a result the primary area of focus in order to
	minimise power consumption is the resistances associated with the
	motion of the belt conveyor. The energy consumed during the operation
	of a long horizontal belt conveyor is primarily due to the frictional
	resistance that occurs along the length of the conveyor. This resistance
	is known as the main resistance and includes the belt and bulk solid
	flexure resistance, the rotating resistance of the idler rolls and
	the indentation rolling resistance of the conveyor belt.
	
	
	This paper will discuss each component of the main resistance and
	provide details of methods to calculate the contribution of each
	component. A finite difference solution that applies orthotropic
	plate mechanics is described to calculate the deflection of the conveyor
	belt due to the loading induced from the weight of the belt and bulk
	solid, and the loading induced from the relative movement of the
	bulk solid. Given the displacement of the belt and bulk solid the
	flexure resistance of each component can then be calculated. The
	rotating resistance of the idler rolls is briefly discussed and an
	apparatus to measure the resistance is presented. A finite element
	model is then discussed which calculates the indentation rolling
	resistance occurring at each idler set from the viscoelastic properties
	of the bottom cover of the conveyor belt.},

  abstract = {Submerged Scraper Conveyors (SSCs) also known as Drag Link Scrapers/De-Ashers,
	are commonly used for the removal of Boiler Bottom Ash (BBA) from
	coal-fired boilers.
	
	
	From a materials handling point of view the SSC therefore performs
	the functions of BBA collection, dewatering of BBA, and controlling
	the rate of discharge into downstream systems. The transport systems
	downstream of the SSC consist of normal belt conveyors. A typical
	modern boiler in Eskom generates BBA at a rate of approximately 10
	TPH. The SSC also provides storage of BBA in the event of failure
	of the downstream plant, this is referred to as unit operational
	"backlog storage".
	
	
	The most common problems associated with SSCs are: 
	
	
	•The high discharge rate of ash over the head pulley during backlog
	recovery. 
	
	
	•Poor dewatering of ash on the dewatering slope, resulting in slurry
	being discharged. 
	
	
	•Ash spillage over the side wall at the intersection between horizontal
	and incline during backlog recovery. 
	
	
	•Potential stalling of the SSC drive due to inadequate drive power
	during "backlog recovery" conditions. 
	
	
	Little information has been published on the behavior of ash in an
	SSC. It was therefore decided to do testing and development work
	on a 1/10 scale model based on the Kendal SSC as well as on a full-scale
	SSC located under a 660 MW boiler at Matimba in order to evaluate
	performance in the process of ash handling.
	
	
	Essential knowledge was gained from the investigations with regard
	to ash movement in the SSC, the ash flow mechanism at the submerged
	intersection between the horizontal section and the dewatering slope,
	and the contribution to absorbed power of ash moving through the
	water bath to the SSC discharge.},
